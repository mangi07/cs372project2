This program was tested on flip.engr.oregonstate.edu
Please use this server to run/test the program.



****INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING*****

(1) Start up the server to listen on <port number>:

$> ftserver <port number>

    **Note that <port number> may not be 30021 or 30020
    and must be in range 1024 to 65535.  Usage messages
    will be displayed if this is not followed.

(2) Start the client:

$> python ftclient.py <hostname> <control portnumber> <command> <data portnumber>

    **Note that you can get a more detailed usage message by running the script
    with no arguments.
    
    **<command> will take either of these forms (without the quotes):
        
    (1)    '-l' to list the server's working directory (recursive listing of all files therein) OR...
        
    (2)    '-g <filename>' to get <filename>
            Test files must be in the working directory to test this.
